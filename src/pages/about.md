I'm Aaron; an engineer, husband, dog dad, brother and uncle.

I normally yap about spacecraft development or engineering in general.

By day I'm a consultant; if you're looking for:

- last minute design reviewing
- chief engineering
- technical due diligence
- just someone to bounce ideas off of

then feel free to dm me on a social, or send me an [email](mailto:aaron@sirrom.systems).
